**CentiPath** is a browser game in which the goal is to fill all 100 squares in a 10x10 grid. You can select from one of (at most) 8 adjacent squares at a time. Once you run out of available squares, it's game over.

This was inspired by my dad, who's played this game for several years on paper but could never find a digital version. I couldn't find one either, so here it is.
